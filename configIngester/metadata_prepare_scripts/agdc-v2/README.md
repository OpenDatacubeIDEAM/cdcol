# AGDC Version 2 Metadata Preparation Script

This script is based in modifications performed to the [base agdc-v2 metadata preparation script](https://github.com/ceos-seo/agdc-v2/blob/master/utils/usgslsprepare.py). This modifications were performed to generate the metadata file needed to perform ingestion in the colomabia agdc v2 datacube. 

* The metadata geneation script needed for agdc colombian datacube resides on this repository https://gitlab.virtual.uniandes.edu.co/datacube-ideam/agdc-v2/blob/desacoplado/utils/usgslsprepare.py.

* we copy that file here to be accesible by the ingestion script.
